### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

1. **Extract this entire folder** to a location like `C:\HW_Helper\`

2. **Double-click:** `setup_and_run.bat`

3. **Follow the prompts** - the script will:
   - Check for Python installation
   - Install all dependencies automatically
   - Check for Brave browser
   - Launch the application

4. **Done!** The app will open automatically.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Install Python 3.9+** from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - ⚠️ **CHECK "Add Python to PATH"** during installation!

2. **Open Command Prompt** in this folder:
   - Hold Shift + Right-click → "Open PowerShell window here"
   - Or: `cd C:\path\to\HW_Helper\`

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```cmd
   python ui.py
   ```
